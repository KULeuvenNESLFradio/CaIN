# CaIN.github
CaIN introduces a novel near-field mesh networking system that combines ultra-low power with low-latency performance. Operating in the VHF frequency band at 40MHz, CaIN uses capacitive and inductive effects to transmit data efficiently, achieving sub-microwatt power consumption and sub-millisecond wake-up times
